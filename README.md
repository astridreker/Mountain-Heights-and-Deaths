This is a project that I and one Petra Radinkovic created for our Data Science course. We opted to look at the correlation between mountain height and deaths of climbers.
You can find the data sets we used within the repository.
We did some data analysis and found that for every 100 additional meters on a mountain, you can expect approximately 18 more deaths occuring on the mountain.
This does not account for mountain popularity- though that would be a super interesting addition to this project.
We also looked a little bit at how height of mountain impacts cause of death which we found interesting, though it all makes logical sense.
